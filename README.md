# art-data

A sample full stack project :)

1.<code>/backend</code> contains the Node.js app which is basically a wrapper around the [Artsy API](https://developers.artsy.net/) (with some simple logic to reuse the token while still valid).

2.<code>/frontend</code> is a Next.js React app that consumes the <code>/api/fairs</code> endpoint.
